ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

From javanervousvm:
* .gitignore
* lib/
* lib/protobuf-java-2.5.0-javadoc.jar
From nervous:
* LICENSE
* README.md
* build.xml
* build/
* build/nervous.apk
* ic_launcher-web.png
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

In javanervousvm:
* lib/protobuf-java-2.5.0.jar => javanervousvm/lib/protobuf-java-2.5.0.jar
* src/ => javanervousvm/src/main/java/
In nervous:
* AndroidManifest.xml => nervous/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
* jni/ => nervous/src/main/jni/
* libs/android-support-v4.jar => nervous/libs/android-support-v4.jar
* libs/protobuf-java-2.5.0-javadoc.jar => nervous/libs/protobuf-java-2.5.0-javadoc.jar
* libs/protobuf-java-2.5.0.jar => nervous/libs/protobuf-java-2.5.0.jar
* lint.xml => nervous/lint.xml
* res/ => nervous/src/main/res/
* src/ => nervous/src/main/java/

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

(This import summary is for your information only, and can be deleted
after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
